#### Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions, written in clean and modern Python!

This repository is meant to capture the cozy feeling of winter coding nights: warm tea ☕, 
soft lights ✨, and tricky puzzles to unwrap every day 🎁.



#### Each day has its own dedicated folder, containing the puzzle input and the solution file:

    day01/

       ├── day01.py
       └── input.txt
    day02/

       ├── day02.py
       └── input.txt
...


#### Each script automatically loads input.txt from the current working directory, so you must run the file from inside the appropriate day folder.

▶️ **Running a Solution**

```Navigate to the puzzle folder:```

```cd day01```

Run the solution:

```python day01.py```


🎉 Results will be printed to the console.

❗ **Important:**

You must run the script inside its folder because it expects:

input.txt
